# GLA-coding-exercise
Take home challenge for a Software Developer Apprentice position at GLA Digital Experience Unit

## Task

Write a lightweight process (script, app, etc…) using any suitable language, that can:

    1. Retrieve a list of URLs from this following XML sitemap: https://www.london.gov.uk/sitemap.xml?page=1 (page 1 only), 
    2. Search through the webpage content of each URL for a user defined keyword or phrase (e.g. “the Mayor of London”),
    3. Output a report with the total number of times the keyword or phrase was found and list the URL it was found in.

Note: The process should search the HTML <body> of each webpage only and not any other content such as the HTML headers, metadata or inline/attached JavaScript or CSS.
At your interview you will be asked to present you approach with consideration your method to search through a list of URLs and the page content, how you can make this process as user friendly as possible for a user wishing to search each webpage, while ensuring you do not cause undue load on the website you are searching.

This challenge should take no more than an hour and steps 2 and 3 are the most important ones, so feel free to manually produce a short list (of say 100 URLs) if time it tight.
Your method of presentation is up to you, but the panel would like to see your thought process and coding. So, consider storing your code and sharing with the interview panel through GitHub.
